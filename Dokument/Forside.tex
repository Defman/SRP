    In the following, you will read and learn about Monte Carlo Method and and how it is to be perceived as a general thought of mind that have evolved into different methods and algorithms of approximating problems. It was first developed by Stanislaw Ulam during the Manhattan Project and was used to solve the problem of neutron diffusion. The problem of neutron diffusion is complex, so much in fact that they could not derive it algebraically. They therefor looked into means of approximating neutrons diffusion and that let to Monte Carlo Method. Further more, you will read how this method was adopted to solve integrates that is not other wise solvable and how random sampling is used to do so. The methods for solving such integrates is often referred to as numerical integration and in the following we will be using the method Hit-or-Miss to approximate $\pi$. At last you will read how the method can be used to locate an autonomous robot in given localized area. The method of localizing is not inherently robust, but can be made so by introducing noice particles.
